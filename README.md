# Student Performance Analysis

This project uses machine learning to analyze and predict student academic performance based on data from the UCI repository.

# Key Features
- Explores socio-economic, academic, and behavioral factors affecting student performance.
- Implements models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVC for prediction.
- Highlights the importance of intermediate grades (G1 and G2) in predicting final grades (G3).

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `student-performance-analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

# Results
Achieved:
- Accuracy up to 98% with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- Insights into key variables impacting academic performance.

# Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  
[Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance).
